 # PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND LONG-SHORT MEMORY NETWORKS ON MALARIA DISEASE

 An infectious disease called malaria is caused   by protozoan parasites of the Plasmodium family, which may be transmitted by the bite of the genius Anopheles dipteran or by a contaminated needle or transfusion. Falciparum protozoal infection is the most deadly type. (Davis, 2023).
 Mosquito bites send parasites to the blood of an individual, which then travels to the liver to mature and reproduce. The most affected continents by widespread malaria are South-East Asia and Africa. These continents and places in the world with high malaria death typically suffer hygiene and healthcare problems (Centre for Disease Control, 2021). Convolutional Neural Networks, a class of deep learning models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using deep learning techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.
